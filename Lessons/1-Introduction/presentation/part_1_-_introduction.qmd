# Introduction

### Definition

::: {.definition-block}
Machine Learning (ML)

Feeding **data** into a computer **algorithm** in order to learn **patterns** and make **predictions** in new and different **situations**.
:::

::: {.definition-block}
ML Model

**Computer object** implementing a **ML algorithm**, trained on a **set of data** to perform a **given task**.
:::

# Definitions

## Categories of ML

### Type of dataset

- **Supervised**: for each input in the dataset, the expected output is also part of the dataset
- **Unsupervised**: for each input in the dataset, the expected output is **not** part of the dataset
- **Semi-supervised**: only a portion of the inputs of the dataset have their expected output in the dataset
- **Reinforcement**: there is no predefined dataset, but an environment giving feedback to the model when it takes actions

### Type of output

- **Classification**: assigning one (or multiple) label(s) chosen from a given list of classes to each element of the input
- **Regression**: assigning one (or multiple) value(s) chosen from a continuous set of values
- **Clustering**: create categories by grouping together similar inputs

## Dataset

### Dataset

::: {.definition-block}
Dataset

A collection of data used to train, validate and test ML models. 
:::

### Content

::: {.definition-block}
Instance (or sample)

An instance is one individual entry of the dataset.
:::

::: {.definition-block}
Feature (or attribute or variable)

A feature is a type of information stored in the dataset about each instance.
:::

::: {.definition-block}
Label (or target or output or class)

A label is a piece of information that the model must learn to predict.
:::

### Subsets

::: {.definition-block}
Dataset subsets

A ML dataset is usually subdivided into three disjoint subsets, with distinctive role in the training process:

- **Training set**: used during training to train the model,
- **Validation set**: used during training to assess the generalization capability of the model, tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting,
- **Test set**: used after training to evaluate the performance of the model on new data it has not encountered before.
:::

# Overview of ML methods

## Supervised Learning

### Linear Regression

Used for predicting continuous values:

- **Simple**: $y = \alpha + \beta x$
- **Multiple**: $y = \alpha + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \cdots + \beta_n x_n$
- **Polynomial**: $y = \alpha + \beta_1 x + \beta_2 x^2 + \cdots + \beta_n x^n$
- and many others...

### Logistic Regression

Used for binary classification problems:

- **Binomial**: only two possible categories
- **Multinomial**: three or more possible categories
- **Ordinal**: three or more possible categories which are ordered

### Decision Trees

A tree-like structure used for both classification and regression

![Decision Tree^[Black Dragon https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31786347/how-to-make-python-decision-tree-more-understandable]](images/Decision_tree.png){height="500px"}

### Random Forests

An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees:

- Train independently $B$ trees using:
  - **Bagging**: each tree is fitted on a random subset of the training set
  - **Feature bagging**: each split in the decision tree (i.e. each node) is chosen among a subset of the features
- Take a decision by aggregating individual decisions of each tree

### Boosting

An ensemble method that combines weak learners (usually decision trees) to form a stronger model:

- Choose a simple **base learner** (e.g. small decision trees with fixed number of leaves)
- Repeatedly:
  - Train a new base learner on the weighted training set
  - Add this new learner to the ensemble
  - Give more weight in the training set to misclassified data

### $k$-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

A non-parametric method for classification and regression

![k-NN Classification^[By Antti Ajanki AnAj - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=2170282]](images/KnnClassification.svg){height="500px"}

### Naive Bayes

A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem

### Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Used for classification and regression, effective in high-dimensional spaces:

- Separate the feature space using optimal hyperplanes
- Features are mapped in a higher dimensional space to allow to fit non-linearly in the original feature space

![SVM kernel trick: map features to a higher dimensional space to be able to separate classes using a hyperplane^[By Original: Alisneakyâ€‚Vector: Zirguezi - Own work based on: Kernel Machine.png, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=47868867]](images/SVM_Kernel_Machine.svg){height="350px"}

## Unsupervised Learning

### $k$-Means Clustering

A method for partitioning data into $k$ clusters:

- $k$ must be chosen before
- Create clusters around iteratively improved center points
- Classical method with lots of variation

![$k$-Means Clustering convergence process^[By Chire - Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=59409335]](images/K-means_convergence.gif){height="300px"}

### Hierarchical Clustering

Builds a hierarchy of clusters using either agglomerative or divisive methods:

- Build a full hierarchy top-down (divisive) or bottom-up (agglomerative)
- Create any number of clusters by cutting the tree

![Hierarchical Clustering^[By [[:File:Hierarchical_clustering_diagram.png#file|]]: Stathis Sideris on 10/02/2005derivative work: Mhbrugman (talk) - [[:File:Hierarchical_clustering_diagram.png#file|]], CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=7344806]](images/Hierarchical_clustering_simple_diagram.svg){height="350px"}

### Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)

Clustering based on the density of data points:

- Divides points in 4 categories: core points (in red below), directly reachable (yellow), reachable and outliers (blue)
- Only two parameters: radius size ($\epsilon$) and number of neighbors to be core ($min_{pts}$)

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Dimensionality reduction technique to project data into lower dimensions:

- Project data into a space of lower dimension
- Keep as much variance (so as much information) as possible

:::
::::

### State-Action-Reward-State-Action (SARSA)

The *On Policy* version of Q-Learning (which is *Off Policy*). On Policy and Off Policy differ on the policy that is used during training to take the decisions:

- The exact same policy that is currently learnt for *On Policy*
- Another policy for *Off Policy*

### Policy Gradient Methods

Optimize the policy by adjusting parameters in the direction that improves performance (e.g., REINFORCE algorithm)

### Actor-Critic Methods

Combination of an *Actor* and a *Critic* learning simultaneously:

- The Actor learns the policy through a parametrized function
- The Critic estimates the value of each action and gives feedback to the Actor

# Introduction to Neural Networks (NN)

### Recurrent

Type of layers designed to process sequential data such as text, time series data, speech or audio. Works by combining input data and the state of the previous time step.

The two main variants of recurrent layers are:

![Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)^[By fdeloche - Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=60149410]](images/Long_Short-Term_Memory.svg)

:::

Nowadays, transformer architectures are however preferred to process sequential data.

### Pooling

A type of layers used to reduce the number of features by merging multiple features into one. There are multiple kinds of pooling layers, the most simple ones being Maximum Pooling and Average Pooling.

![Max Pooling Example^[By Daniel Voigt Godoy - https://github.com/dvgodoy/dl-visuals/, CC BY 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=150823502]](images/Convolutional_neural_network_maxpooling.png)

### Residual

A Residual Block aims at stabilizing training and convergence of deep neural networks (with a large number of layers), by adding the input of a given layer to the output of another layer further down in the architecture.

![Residual Block skipping two layers^[By LunarLullaby - Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=131458370]](images/ResBlock.png){height="400px"}

### Attention

Attention aims at determining relative importance of each part of the input to make better predictions. It is used a lot in natural language processing (NLP) and image processing.

![Attention mechanism in seq2seq with RNN^[By Google - https://github.com/google/seq2seq, Apache License 2.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=150802792]](images/Seq2seq_with_RNN_and_attention_mechanism.gif)

### And a lot more...

- **Dropout**: randomly drop out some of the nodes during training to reduce overfitting
- **Batch Normalization**: normalize the input of each layer across the batch to improve training stability and speed
- **Layer Normalization**: normalize the input of each layer across the features to improve training stability and speed
- **Embedding**: transforms discrete input data into continuous vectors with lower-dimensional space
- **Flatten**: convert multi-dimensional data into 1D data that can be fed into fully connected layers
- ...

## NN training

### Loss Function - Definition

A loss function is a mathematical function that quantifies the difference between the network's predicted output and the actual target values. The goal during training is to minimize this loss by adjusting the model's weights, using gradient descent.

The most common loss functions are:

- Mean Squares Error (MSE) for regression
- Cross-entropy Loss for classification

### Loss Function - Differentiable

To be able to perform gradient descent, the loss function must be differentiable, which means continuous (no jump) and smooth (no sudden change of direction).

::: {layout-ncol=2}

![Examples of differentiable functions [@kwiatkowski2020]](images/Differentiable_functions.webp)

![Examples of non-differentiable functions [@kwiatkowski2020]](images/Not_differentiable_functions.webp)

:::

### Loss Function - Convex

To get the best results when performing gradient descent, it is also better if the function is convex. The simplest definition of convexity is that if you trace a straight line between two points on the curve, the curve will be below the segment between the two points.

![Example of convex and non-convex functions [@kwiatkowski2020]](images/Convex_functions.webp)

### Gradient Descent - Definition

::: {.definition-block}
Gradient Descent

The process of iteratively computing and following the direction of the gradient of a function to (hopefully) reach the minimum value of the function (if it exists).
:::

Gradient Descent works because at any point in the definition space of the function, the gradient points in the direction of the steepest angle. So locally, following this direction is the quickest way to get to the lower value of the function. If we come back to the requirements listed before:

- Differentiable functions are functions where the gradient exists everywhere
- Convex functions are convenient for gradient descent because they have only one minimum value and slowly going down the function will always lead to the minimum value.

### Gradient Descent - Algorithm

Gradient Descent boils down to iteratively:

1. Compute the gradient of the loss function at the current point
2. Make a step towards the direction of the gradient to a new point
3. Repeat step 1 until we stop

In this process, the three things that have to be defined are:

- The starting point (weights initialization)
- The size of the steps (learning rate)
- The condition to stop

### Gradient Descent - Weights initialization

The starting point is defined by the first output of the model, and therefore by the initial values of the weights of the model. There are numerous methods to initialize the weights, but the most common one is to randomly initialize them using a **centered and normalize Gaussian distribution**.

### Gradient Descent - Learning rate

The gradient gives us a direction and a norm, but this norm is arbitrary and has to be rescaled using what we call the **learning rate**. The learning rate doesn't define the size of the steps, but the scalar factor to apply to the gradient's norm, which means that the norm still plays a crucial role.

The choice of the learning rate is crucial to hopefully converge **quickly** to the **global** minimum loss.

![Example of gradient descent on the same function with different learning rates [@kwiatkowski2020]](images/Gradient_descent_different_learning_rates.webp)

### Gradient Descent - Stop condition

The stop condition determines when you decide to stop the algorithm. An easy solution is to choose a number of steps before launching the algorithm, but this will either imply useless computations after the algorithm has reached a final point, or stopping too early and not get the best results possible.

Therefore, although there are more complex methods, the most common and simple process is to monitor the value of the loss, memorize the lowest value ever reached, and stop when there has been a given number of steps without any improvement to the best value. Then, we usually keep the model weights corresponding to this best value.

### Gradient Descent - Unlucky examples

![Examples with a saddle point [@kwiatkowski2020]](images/Gradient_descent_different_learning_rates_saddle.webp){height="200px"}

![Animated example with a saddle point [@kwiatkowski2020]](images/Gradient_descent_unlucky_example.gif){height="250px"}

### Backpropagation

Gradient Descent is beautiful, but right now, we only know in which direction (the gradient) the **output** of the model should go. To transmit this information to the weights of the layers of the model, we use backpropagation.

::: {.definition-block}
Backpropagation

The process of computing the gradient of the weights of each layer of the model and modify them accordingly. The name comes from the process starting with the last layer of the model and propagating incrementally to the first layer.

# Usual pipeline

### Overview

1. Data acquisition
2. Data preprocessing
3. Model selection
4. Model evaluation
5. Final model training

### Data acquisition

Gather the data, potentially from multiple different sources. Choosing the right sources can also depend on the choices made in the next steps.

## Data preprocessing

### Different issues

Multiple sources of issues and steps to perform:
1. Handle different formats
2. Remove outliers (mostly for raw data)
3. (Optionally) extract features
4. Handle missing data
5. Normalize

### Why normalization?

:::{example-block}
Idea

*A priori* all features have the same importance, so none of them should have an advantage. Therefore, having features with larger values than others would be detrimental.
:::

Usually, all features are individually normalized over the whole dataset, to obtain a distribution with an average of 0 and a standard deviation of 1:

$$
\begin{align*}
\hat{X} & = \sum\limits_{j=0}^n X_j \\
\sigma_X & = \sum\limits_{j=0}^n (X_j - \hat{X})^2 \\
\forall k \in [0, \cdots, n ], X_k & = \frac{X_k - \hat{X}}{\sigma_X}
\end{align*}
$$

### Model selection

- Type of model (ML, NN, DL, ...)
- Complexity:
  - Number of features
  - Type of output
  - Size of the layers (for NN)
  - Number of layers (for NN)
- Hyperparameters

### Model training

- Loss selection: depends on the task, the objectives, the specific issues to solve
- Training process selection (lots of different tweaks and improvements can be implemented in NN training)
- Hyperparameter tuning, by repeatedly:
  - Selecting one or multiple configurations of hyperparameters
  - Training the model one or multiple times
  - Determining the best hyperpatameters

### Model evaluation

- Criteria selection among the many possible ones:
  - For classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score...
  - For regression: Mean Absolute Error, Mean Square Error (MSE)...
  - ...
- **Cross-validation** to estimate real performance of the model:
  1. Split the dataset in multiple parts (usually 5)
  2. Using different combinations of these parts (usually 5), train and evaluate the model

![Cross-validation^[By Gufosowa - Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=82298768]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)#/media/File:K-fold_cross_validation_EN.svg)

### Final model training

Once the data is preprocessed, the model is selected, the hyperparameters chosen and optimized, the final model can be trained multiple times to keep the best one.

# Challenges

### Data

- Quality
- Diversity
- Biases and fairness (example of crime prediction)

### Underfitting and Overfitting

- Cross-validation
- Feature selection
- Regularization
- Ensemble methods
- Model complexity (increase if high bias and reduce if high variance)
- Early stopping (overfitting)
- Training data size (underfitting)

### Bias and variance (stability)
