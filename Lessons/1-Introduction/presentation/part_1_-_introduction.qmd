# Introduction

### Definition

::: {.definition-block}
Machine Learning (ML)

Feeding **data** into a computer **algorithm** in order to learn **patterns** and make **predictions** in new and different **situations**.
:::

### Dataset



# Categories of ML

### Available data

- Supervised: for each input in the dataset, the expected output is also part of the dataset
- Unsupervised: for each input in the dataset, the expected output is **not** part of the dataset
- Semi-supervised: only a portion of the inputs of the dataset have their expected output in the dataset
- Reinforcement: there is no predefined dataset, but an environment giving feedback to the model when it takes actions

### Output

- Classification: assigning one (or multiple) label(s) chosen from a given list of classes to each element of the input
- Regression: assigning one (or multiple) value(s) chosen from a continuous set of values
- Clustering: create categories by grouping together similar inputs

# Usual pipeline

# Challenges

## Data

- Quality
- Diversity
- Biases and fairness (example of crime prediction)

## Underfitting and Overfitting

## Interpretable and Explainable

### Definitions

::: {.definition-block}
Interpretable

Qualifies a ML model which decision-making process is straightforward and **transparent**, making it directly **understandable** by humans. This requires to restrict the model **complexity**.
:::

::: {.definition-block}
Explainable

Qualifies a ML model which decision-making process can be partly interpreted afterwards using **post hoc interpretation techniques**. 
:::

### Examples

- Example of the model detecting fishes using human hands
- Depends a lot on the technique that is used
